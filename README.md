# prog2370final
Final project for the PROG2370: Game Programming with Data Structures course.
The project involves making a 2D or 3D game using the Monogame framework.
My game is a 3D isometric shooter.

This was programmed in Visual Studio.
The code shown here are the functional code from the game.

NOTE: The code is not optimized nor refactored, due to time constraints and lack of experience in utilizing the Monogame framework. However, all project requirements were met or exceeded.
