# prog2370final
Final project for the PROG2370: Game Programming with Data Structures course.
The project involves making a 2D or 3D game using the Monogame framework.
My game is a 3D isometric shooter.

Click on the Project folder to view the .cs files.

This was programmed in Visual Studio.
The code shown here are the functional code from the game.
Due to potential copyright issues game assets such as models, textures, music and soundeffects are not uploaded.

NOTE: The code is not optimized nor refactored, due to time constraints and lack of experience in utilizing the Monogame framework. However, all project requirements were met or exceeded.
